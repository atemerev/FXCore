/** Position
  * This is the implementation of a position taken in some asset against the other. For example, it can be
  * "-100 EUR / 137 USD", which probably means (dependent on context) that 100 euro had been short-sold for 137 US dollars.
  * Thus, a position has following fields:
  *
  * primary: amount in primary asset, like "-100 EUR" in the example above;
  * secondary: amount in secondary asset, like "137 USD" in the example above;
  * matching: an UUID of a matching position in some portfolio. In some contexts, if a position is applied to portfolio
  * with matching position, these positions will be merged;
  * timestamp: position's creation time;
  * uuid: this position's UUID.
