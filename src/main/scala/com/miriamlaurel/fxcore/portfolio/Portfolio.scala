/*!#Portfolio
There can be many different types of portfolios, but all they have common properties summarized by this trait:

trait Portfolio {

  /*!
  A diff value may be applied to this portfolio, giving new (changed) portfolio;
   */
  def apply(diff: PortfolioDiff): Portfolio

  /*!
  List of all portfolio positions;
   */

  List of portfolio positions by instrument. In "strict" portfolio implementation, this list always contain
  zero or one positions.
   */
  def positions(instrument: Instrument): Iterable[Position]

  /*!
  "Accept" operation takes a position and "applies" it to portfolio, producing new portfolio and diff value --
  set of changes.
   */
  def <<(position: Position): (Portfolio, PortfolioDiff)

  /*!
  Total amount of all positions in portfolio (expressed in their primary asset). Not that useful beyond
  forex portfolios, though...

  Total profit/loss for all positions in portfolio. Since it can be calculated in any asset (currency), a
  Market instance is required.
